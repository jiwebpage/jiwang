      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>I was born in 1990 in Fujian, China. I am currently an associate professor in the Department of Automation at Xiamen University, China. I received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Jimei University and Chongqing University, China, in 2012 and 2018, respectively, both in Mechanical Engineering. From 2019 to 2021, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at University of California, San Diego, USA.  I has coauthored (with M. Krstic) the book entitled <em>PDE Control of String-Actuated Motion</em> (Princeton University Press). My research interests are control and estimation of distributed parameter systems, adaptive control, safe control, and applications in flexible robots.
